# invoice
This repository includes a basic Payslip API built with Spring boot, and JPA, mysql and for demonstration purposes.

# Run
running this app in two ways
1) Spring tool(STS): move cursure to App module and Right click on it. There you can see some options Run As> Spring Boot App
2) Eclipse: just like the above step up to "Run As", but you did not see the Spring Boot App. So you need to Select Run Configuration.
    There you need to type "spring-boot:run" as it is without quotes.

Actually i prefer and used STS.

# Test
Similarly you will find an option called "JUnit test" like Spring Boot App

# Endpoints

/invoice/employee
The above end point is for GET as well as POST or employee
